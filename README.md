Data Source >> https://www.kaggle.com/atulanandjha/temperature-readings-iot-devices

This dataset contains the temperature readings from IOT devices installed outside and inside of an anonymous Room (say - admin room). The device was in the alpha testing phase. So, It was uninstalled or shut off several times during the entire reading period ( 28-07-2018 to 08-12-2018). This random interval recordings and few mis-readings ( outliers) makes it more challanging to perform analysis on this data. Let's see, what you can present in the plate out of this messy data.

## Pose at least three questions related to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used.

1 ) Did the equipment collect the data in the same amount each month?

2 ) What is the hottest period ?

3 ) What was the coldest day in the data collection period ?


## Python Library used in this Project
